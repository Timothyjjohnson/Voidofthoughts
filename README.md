1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  Answe: The project aimed to create a program for the Corner Grocer to analyze item purchase data, helping them optimize their store layout based on item frequencies throughout the day.
2. What did you do particularly well?
  Answer: I effectively implemented the menu-driven interface and file handling operations. Using C++ classes and maps allowed me to organize data logically and efficiently.
3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  Answer: Improving user input validation could enhance robustness. This would involve ensuring the program gracefully handles unexpected inputs to prevent crashes or incorrect behavior.
4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  Answer: Writing the histogram output (Menu Option Three) posed a challenge initially. I overcame this by carefully iterating through the data and formatting the output correctly, using resources like C++ reference sites and examples.
5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Answer: Skills in data handling, file I/O, and using maps for data organization are highly transferable. These skills are foundational in various programming tasks, from data analysis to system development.
6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Answer: I maintained code clarity through consistent naming conventions, inline comments explaining complex logic, and modularizing code into functions for reusability. Adapting to potential future changes would involve updating these comments and keeping functions focused on single responsibilities.
